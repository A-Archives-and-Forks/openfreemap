## Using Mapbox?

If you are currently using Mapbox, please change your libraries to [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/). MapLibre is based on the last open-source version of Mapbox GL JS before it went closed-source. Migrating should be as simple as changing the libraries, as long as you are not using any features specific to the 2.x or later releases.
