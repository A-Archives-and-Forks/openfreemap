## What is OpenFreeMap?

OpenFreeMap provides free map hosting so you can display custom maps on your website and apps.

It is truly **free**: there are no limits on the number of map views or requests you can make, nor on how you use your map. There is no registration page, user database, API keys, or cookies.

It is truly **open-source**: everything, including the full production setup, is on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap). Map data is from OpenStreetMap.
