# OpenFreeMap

## What is this?

OpenFreeMap is a free, open-source OpenStreetMap based map hosting service for everyone. 

It's truly free: there is no limit on the amount of map views or requests you can make.

Actually, there is not even a registration page or a user database, there are no API keys nor cookies.

It's truly open source, not open core. Everything, including the last production detail is up on GitHub.

## Why is this important?

OpenStreetMap is one of the most important collective projects in history. More than 3 million edits are made each day, over 2 million users have contributed to the project so far.

The problem starts when you want to use a map on your website or app: you need to look for a commercial map provider and hope your site doesn't get too popular, otherwise you might end up with a $10,000 bill in a single day, like Hoodmaps did [*](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1730659933232730443).

Or you can try self-hosting, but it requires a big server and a lot of time to get it right. 

Well, it required: OpenFreeMap also allows you to self-host with a single command.

## Who is behind this project and why?

I'm Zsolt Ero (twitter, blog). I've created [MapHub](https://maphub.net/) and I've been running map hosting in production for 8 years.

Why did I make this? Because I waited for years for someone to offer this service, but realised no one is going to make it. So, I thought I might use my map hosting experience and do it.

I'll share more about the why in a blog post in the future, feel free to subscribe on the links above.

## How can I use it?

Include [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) in `<head>`

```
<script src='https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl.js'></script>
<link href='https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl.css' rel='stylesheet'/>
```

And use the following in your HTML:

```
<div id='map' style='width: 600px; height: 400px;'></div>

<script>
var map = new maplibregl.Map({
	style: 'https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty',
  center: [-74.5, 40],
  zoom: 9,
  container: 'map',
})
</script>
```

If you've used Mapbox GL before, please migrate to MapLibre. It is based on the last open-source version of Mapbox GL, before it went closed-source. A Leaflet based snippet is coming soon.

For mobile apps, you can do the same with [MapLibre Native.](https://maplibre.org/)

#### Is commercial usage allowed?

Yes.



#### How can this work? How can a one person project offer unlimited tile hosting for free?

There is no technical reason why vector tile hosting should cost as much as it does today. 

Vector tiles are just static files. OK, serving 300 million files is not easy, but at the end of the day they are just files.

Financially, the plan is basically I keep buying Hetzner servers until they cover the load. I believe it can work, if enough people contribute with the support plans.



### What is the tech stack?

The map schema is [OpenMapTiles](https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles).

The tiles are generated by [Planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler).

There is no tile server running, only BTRFS partition images with 300 million hard linked files. 

The server is nginx on Ubuntu.

There is no cloud, just dedicated servers on Hetzner.

Currently using Cloudflare, but designed so that it can be changed any time.

Moreover, a lot of work went into customising the styles at [openfreemap-styles](https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap-styles).



### What about PMTiles hosted on the cloud?

I would have loved to use PMTiles, they are a brilliant idea!

Unfortunately, making range requests in 80 GB files is just not working in production. They are fine for  < 500 MB files, but have terrible latency and caching issues for full planet datasets.
