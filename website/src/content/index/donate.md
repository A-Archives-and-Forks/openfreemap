On **Gold** level and above, we offer personalised technical support by email. Otherwise, support is via GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap/discussions).

If we ever receive a **Diamond** level supporter, we'll put their logo on this page.

When subscribing to a support plan, you receive an invoice for each of your payments.

Note: if you want to make a single donation, you can do this via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hyperknot). However, please understand that the nature of this project needs recurring donations to cover the server costs.
