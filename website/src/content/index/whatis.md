## What is OpenFreeMap?

OpenFreeMap lets you display custom maps on your website and apps for free.

You can either self-host or use our public instance. Everything is **open-source**, including the full production setup — there’s no 'open-core' model here. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap). The map data comes from OpenStreetMap.

Using our public instance is completely **free**: there are no limits on the number of map views or requests, and no restrictions on how you use your map. There’s no registration, no user database, no API keys, and no cookies. We aim to cover the running costs of our public instance through donations.
