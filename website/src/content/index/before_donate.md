## Who is behind this project and how can I follow it?

I'm Zsolt Ero ([blog](https://blog.hyperknot.com/), [email](mailto:zsolt@openfreemap.org)).

After 9 years of running my own map tile infrastructure for [MapHub](https://maphub.net/), I've open-sourced it and launched OpenFreeMap.

## Why did you build this project?

OpenStreetMap is one of the most important collective projects in history. It began 20 years ago, and today, 3 million edits are made each day!

For a long time, when you wanted to use the map on your website or app, you had to look for a commercial map tile provider and hope your site didn't become too popular. Otherwise, you might end up with a $10,000 bill in a single day, as Hoodmaps [did](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1730659933232730443).

Self-hosting was an option, but it required a big server and a lot of time to get it right.

Since I've spent many years developing the map tile infrastructure for [MapHub](https://maphub.net/), I decided to open-source it so anyone can use it. With OpenFreeMap, you now have the option to either set up your own server or use our public instance.

## How can you offer a free public instance?

There is no technical reason why map hosting costs as much as it does today. Vector tiles are just static files. It's true that serving hundreds of millions of files is not easy, but at the end of the day, they are just files.

Financially, the plan is to keep renting servers until they cover the bandwidth. I believe it can be self-sustainable if enough people subscribe to the support plans.

If this project helps you save on your map hosting costs, please consider subscribing to a support plan.
